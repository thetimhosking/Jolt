Domain driven design and data architecture come together to speed your delivery of software 

This project provides a number of high-level bounded contexts to guide a micro-service architeture for just about any organisation or business software. It is based on a well defined business architecture that should be used by any commercial, government, or non-profit organisation.

The foundation principle for the business architecture is:
A business exists to deliver products or services to clients in their constituent market segments via a business model and strategy that delivers a desired return on investment. 

The decisions about what products and services to deliver and the business model(s) to use are driven by the organisation's strategy. 

An organisation's strategy is defined by its:
- Mission - why the organisation exists and where the organisation sees itself in the world
- Vision - where the organisation wants to go
- Goals and objectives - how the organisation will measure its progress towards the vision

The Business Model consists of the story and numbers that describe how the organisation will deliver its desired return on investment by making choices about the channels, level of quality, pricing, and market segments to target.

To deliver the services and products within the selected business models and strategy, the organisation needs to manage:
- Data
- Process
- Business rules
- Resources - human, technical, financial, and informational

To measure progress towards the goals and objectives, the organisation must gather information at the across the entire delivery chain. Worklaod indicators and performance measures are gathered and used to assist in decision-making and to report against the strategy. These decisions affect the projects and other initiatives that deliver the capabilities needed to support the evolving strategy.

An understanding of the influences exerted on the organisation, both internally and externally, will help miitgate against risks and maximise opportunities for improved product and service delivery.

A software architecture that aligns with this understanding of the behaviour of any business can be more resilient to change.

This project attempts to define the data domains to support this thinking. These domains can contribute to a microservice architecture and provide patterns for the development of software components within boudned contexts.
