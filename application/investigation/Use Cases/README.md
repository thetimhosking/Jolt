Investigation cases follow the "managed activity" pattern:

1. Initiate
2. Assess
3. Plan
4. Conduct
5. Coordinate
6. Monitor
7. Close
8. Review

1. Does this matter fall into our jurisdiction?
2. If in our jursidiction, to whom should it be assigned? How urgent is it? What is its priority?
3. If not in our jurisdiction, where should it be referred?
4. What are the initial facts of the case?
5. Identify the incidents to be investigated.
