# Arrangement

An arrangement is the domain in which rights and obligations, or entitlements are conferred on the parties involved. 

It covers concepts like accounts, contracts, memorandum of understanding, agreements about services provided, etc. 

One party may be seen as the "controlling party", or each party may have equal interests. 

Arrangements are usually stored or structured according to one perspective - the owner of the software.

Arrangements can provide for agreements on quality of service, discounts, bonuses (e.g. loyalty programs), bulk purchase agreements, etc.

Products and services are usually delivered according to arrangements. 

Arrangements are also made with suppliers, partners, and intermediaries. Government entities are also involved in arrangements, providing oversight or regulatory governance.
