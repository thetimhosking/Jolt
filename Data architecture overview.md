# Data architecture overview

The data architecture consists of the following contexts:

## Activity
The things the organisation does across its value chain.
The main goal of these activities is to deliver products and services to clients in their constituent market segments. However, they also consist of the "backroom" activities that support the organisation.

## Arrangement
An arrangement confers rights and obligations, or entitlements on the parties involved. 

It covers concepts like contracts, memorandum of understanding, agreements about services provided, etc.

## Channel
A channel is the means by which a product or service is delivered. Examples include, digital, shopfront, call centre, etc.

## Event
An event is an occurrence, involving parties, locations, and a specific date and time or a range.

Often confused with activities, an event is often the observation of an activity performed by someone else. For example, a supplier to a business performs activities to provide input to the business, but the business may only have visibility of the final delivery of the input.

## Location
A location is some place or point at which communication can be directed, or contact can be made with a Party. This includes geographical addresses, electronic addresses such as a URL, and telephone numbers. Resources can be located at some place.

## Market Segment
A group of parties that share some common characteristic. Such a characteristic may be the need for a product or service, or the manner in which the product or service is delivered.

## Object
Any physical, or intangible thing that is of interest. For example, a component part of a product that is delivered ina supply chain is an object.

## Organisation Influence
An external or internal force that can have an effect on the behaviour of the organisation. This include market forces, regulatory obligations, political issues, technology changes, and environmental factors.

## Party
A person or organisation that has some agency or involvement with other data domains. This domain is concerned mainly with the identity of the person or organisation. Involvement usually occurs in the context of a party role. Separating the party and the role ensures that the details about a party are managed independently, without redundancy and all the data quality issues that often are associated with the identity of parties.

## Party Role
The role that a person or organisation can perform in different contexts. A party may be a supplier and a customer in different contexts. Or, an employee may also be a customer. Customers may also be intermediaries in other contexts.

## Product
A product is the output of some activity, including a service, that can be provided to clients in their constituent market segments. In commercial applications a product is the thing sold, while in a government context it is usually a service provided to the community.

## Resource
Resources are the assets and other things of value that can be used to make products and services. They can be human, technical, information, and financial resources.
